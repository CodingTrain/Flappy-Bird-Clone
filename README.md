# Flappy Bird Clone



Hello welcome to Flappy Bird tutorial

This repository is starting with the code from [Coding Challenge #31 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY). I am accepting pull requests for bug fixes, minor improvements to gameplay, and visual design. I do not want to make the code more complex as the goal is to use this as a basis for a "neuro-evolution" tutorial with the "toy" [neural network library](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS/).

Coding Train themed graphics are welcome! (But keep it simple!)
